{"file_contents":{"replit.md":{"content":"# Age Calculator Application\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a React-based age calculator application that allows users to calculate their exact age in various time units (years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds). The application features real-time age updates, timezone detection, and birthday countdown functionality. It appears to be built with modern React patterns using TypeScript and includes a clean UI with calendar selection and live updates.\n\n## User Preferences\n\nPreferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.\n\n## System Architecture\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience\n- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local component state\n- **Date Handling**: date-fns library for robust date calculations and formatting\n- **UI Components**: Custom UI component library with shadcn/ui patterns including:\n  - Calendar component for date selection\n  - Card components for content organization\n  - Popover components for date picker interactions\n  - Button components for user actions\n- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography\n- **Styling**: Likely uses CSS modules or Tailwind CSS (based on className patterns)\n\n### Key Features\n- **Real-time Age Calculation**: Live updates every second when birth date is selected\n- **Timezone Awareness**: Automatic detection of user's timezone with offset display\n- **Multiple Time Units**: Calculates age in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds\n- **Birthday Countdown**: Shows days until next birthday\n- **Interactive Date Selection**: Calendar popup for easy date picking\n\n### Component Structure\n- Modular component architecture with reusable UI elements\n- TypeScript interfaces for type safety (AgeResult interface)\n- Custom utility functions for styling (cn function)\n\n## External Dependencies\n\n### Core Libraries\n- **React**: Frontend framework\n- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting library\n- **Lucide React**: Icon library\n- **TypeScript**: Type checking and development tooling\n\n### UI Components\n- **shadcn/ui**: Component library providing Calendar, Button, Card, and Popover components\n- Custom utility library for styling functions\n\n### Browser APIs\n- **Intl.DateTimeFormat**: For timezone detection\n- **Date API**: For time calculations and live updates\n\nNote: This analysis is based on a partial code snippet. A complete repository analysis would require access to package.json, additional components, configuration files, and the full project structure.","size_bytes":2551}},"version":1}
